"# Form-Validation" https://paultan09.github.io/Form-Validation/

Basic form validation mockup site, based on The Odin Project's "Sign-Up Form".
It's HTML/CSS only -- so the form isn't sent to any DB, and I couldn't perform password-matching client-side validation either, since I wasn't "allowed" to use JS.
Flexbox-compliant.
